# Plautus Widget

A small converter tool for students and classicists to convert their Plautus citations from act, scene, line to just 
line numbers (in order to conform with the standard of Logeion and other classical tools). 

Works as an external tool with the same configuration as the back-end adjustments to the XML files of the Plautus texts.
